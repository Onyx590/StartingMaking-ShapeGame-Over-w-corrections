# StartingGameProgrammingOver

Hello, After months of existential struggle due to errors that never seemed to budge, I have decided to give game programming a go again with this project. 

The Idea of this project is to create a small geometric game with SFML and ImGUI in which the player shoots at enemy shapes floating across the screen. I originally started this project in another repository, but the errors generated there were so overwhelming (you see where the existential crisis came from) that I decided to start the project again from scratch. In other words, I decided to start game programming from scratch.

*How this project goes might help me decide if I still want to go into game development... wish me luck :)*
